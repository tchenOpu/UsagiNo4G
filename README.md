# UsagiNo4G
Android web browser using SMS for transmission

The application has two modes :

-A server mode which will receive by SMS HTML requests as a URL (for example : "https://woyanoro.alwaysdata.net/weeb/E2/usagino4g.html"). Upon receiving this request, the application will load the page from the internet through the phone connection or wifi, and then process the HTML code before sending it by SMS to the initial caller.

-A client mode which will send by SMS a HTML request, receive the HTML code and display the internet page that is requested.
